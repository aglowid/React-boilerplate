## This boilerplate consists of pre-commit hooks and CI/CD pipeline checks on each pull request to maintain a uniform coding pattern/formatting across the application by every individual. You need to follow below steps so that all these automated pipeline runs smoothly and you donâ€™t face any problem in running the project.

### STEPS TO BE FOLLOWED

1. After taking clone, you need to run command `npm install`
2. Now delete the ".husky" folder. 
3. Run command `npm run husky-install`
4. Run command `npx husky add .husky/pre-commit "npm run lint-staged"`
5. Start your project with `npm start`
6. Don't try to mess with any pre-commit files or eslint rules in your local. Also don't try to bypass these setting else your code will not pass the pipeline checks in pull request.
